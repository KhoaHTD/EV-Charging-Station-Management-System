## Commit 2: OCCUPIED Status Removal (Critical Bug Fix)

```
fix(critical): remove unused OCCUPIED status causing dashboard bugs

BREAKING: ChargingPointStatus.OCCUPIED removed (was never used)

Problem:
- Code set status: AVAILABLE → CHARGING → AVAILABLE
- Queries counted: OCCUPIED (never set!)
- Result: Dashboards always showed 0 active charging points

Solution:
- Removed OCCUPIED from ChargingPointStatus enum
- Updated all queries to count CHARGING instead of OCCUPIED
- Dashboard statistics now accurate

Impact:
- ✅ Dashboards now show correct active charging point counts
- ✅ Station statistics are accurate
- ✅ No database migration needed (OCCUPIED never stored)
- ✅ No API changes (fields remain same)

Files changed:
- ChargingPointStatus.java (removed OCCUPIED)
- StationUsageService.java (OCCUPIED → CHARGING)
- StationService.java (OCCUPIED → CHARGING)
- StaffDashboardService.java (OCCUPIED → CHARGING)
- OverviewService.java (OCCUPIED → CHARGING)

Documentation:
- OCCUPIED_STATUS_REMOVAL.md (detailed analysis)
- OCCUPIED_STATUS_SUMMARY.md (quick reference)
- OCCUPIED_STATUS_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md (testing guide)
- CHARGING_POINT_STATUS_GUIDE.md (developer guide)
- database-verification-occupied-cleanup.sql (DB verification)
- OccupiedStatusRemovalTest.java (integration tests)
- RECENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md (both fixes summary)

Tested: ✅ Build successful, no compilation errors
Priority: CRITICAL (fixes incorrect dashboard metrics)
